## Installation üì¶
Install Structify via Composer:
```bash
composer require mrtolouei/structify
```
<hr />

## How to Use Structify üõ†Ô∏è
### Generate MDSR Files
To generate files for a new entity, run the following command:
```bash
php artisan structify:make-mdsr {EntityName}
```
Replace `{EntityName}` with the name of your entity (e.g., User, Product, Order). Structify will create:
- **Model:** `App/Models/{EntityName}.php`
- **DTO:** `App/Dto/{EntityName}Dto.php`
- **Repository Interface:** `App/Repositories/Interfaces/{EntityName}RepositoryInterface.php`
- **Repository:** `App/Repositories/{EntityName}Repository.php`
- **Service Interface:** `App/Services/Interfaces/{EntityName}ServiceInterface.php`
- **Service:** `App/Services/{EntityName}Service.php`

It will also:
- Create a migration file for the model.
- Update the MdsrServiceProvider to bind interfaces to their implementations.
<hr />

## Example: Generate Files for a Product Entity
Run the following command:
```bash
php artisan structify:make-mdsr Product
```
This will generate:
- `App/Models/Product.php`
- `App/Dto/ProductDto.php`
- `App/Repositories/Interfaces/ProductRepositoryInterface.php`
- `App/Repositories/ProductRepository.php`
- `App/Services/Interfaces/ProductServiceInterface.php`
- `App/Services/ProductService.php`

It will also create a migration file for the Product model and update the MdsrServiceProvider with the necessary bindings.
<hr />

## Customize Stubs üé®
Structify uses stubs to generate files. You can customize these stubs to match your project's coding standards. To publish the stubs, run:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=structify-stubs
```
This will copy the stubs to the `stubs/mdsr` directory in your project. Modify them as needed to fit your coding style.
<hr />

## Service Provider Bindings üîó
Structify automatically updates the `MdsrServiceProvider` to bind repository and service interfaces to their implementations. For example:
```php
$this->app->bind(\App\Repositories\Interfaces\ProductRepositoryInterface::class, \App\Repositories\ProductRepository::class);
$this->app->bind(\App\Services\Interfaces\ProductServiceInterface::class, \App\Services\ProductService::class);
```
<hr />

## Why Structify is SEO-Friendly üåê
- **Clean Code:** Structify promotes clean, modular code, which improves your application's performance‚Äîa key factor for SEO.
- **Scalability:** Build applications that can handle growth without compromising performance.
- **Maintainability:** Well-structured code is easier to maintain and optimize for search engines.
